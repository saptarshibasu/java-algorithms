# Algorithm & Data Structure Study in Java

## Advanced Concepts & Better Programming Ideas

### Avoid Returning null

Instead of returning null values from a function consider returning immutable empty collections created by the `empty*` methods in the `Collections` class, or the `Optional<T>` which was introduced in Java 8. However, `Optional<T>` adds some overhead.

### Immutable Collections For Efficiency

In Java 9, `List`, `Map` and `Set` interfaces provide the factory method `of()` to create immutable lists, maps or sets respectively with known values. This would be efficient when the values are read frequently and modified rarely. Moreover, if the contents are also immutable, the entire collection would be automatically thread safe without the need of any kind of locking.

### Bit Oprations are Faster than Division

a mod 2^i = a & (2^iâ€“1)

e.g. 44 mod 32 = 0010 1100 & 0001 1111 = 0000 1100 = 12

### HashMap Capacity should be a Power of 2

This enables efficiently identifying the bucket from the hashcode

e.g. hashcode & (Capacity - 1) enstead of modulo or division operation

### Sorted Data helps in Branch Prediction

If within a loop there are branching instructions (if else) based on the input data, the loop performance will improve with a sorted input data set due to modern processor branch predictions.

### LinkedHashMap

LinkedHashMap can maintain a specific order of the entries (predictable iteraion order)
- Insertion order
- Access order

The underlying data structure is a doubly linked list.

If the map is constructed to preserve access order, every `get()` call will increase the modCount (which is used by the Iterator to throw ConcurrentMModificationException) and also move the entry before the current head of the LinkedList. This functionality can be used to implement LRU cache, provided the `removeEldestEntry()` is overridden to implement a cache eviction policy.

### Unicode Charset

UTF-8 is the most commonly used Unicode character encoding. It is a variable length Unicode encoding.

### JSON Web Token (JWT) Digital Signature Algorithm

JSON Web Token (JWT) are usually digitally signed by HMAC SHA256

### java.security.SecureRandom

Use `java.security.SecureRandom` for Generating Cryptographic Random Numbers such as nonce, IV (initialization Vector) etc.

## Miscellaneous Code Snippets

### hashCode() implementation of String class

    public int hashCode() {
        int h = hash;
        if (h == 0 && value.length > 0) {
            char val[] = value;

            for (int i = 0; i < value.length; i++) {
                h = 31 * h + val[i];
            }
            hash = h;
        }
        return h;
    }

A decent hash code of any object can be generated as:

    hashCode = 1;
    hashCode = 31 * hashCode + a.hashCode();
    hashCode = 31 * hashCode + b.hashCode();

where a, b are member variables;

A nice property of 31 is that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction for better performance: `31 * i == (i << 5) - i`. Modern VMs do this sort of optimization automatically.

### Convert String to bytes[] & Vice Versa

    byte[] b = string.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

    new String(b, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

### Convert String to char[] & Vice Versa

    char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();

    new String(charArray);

### Generate an AES 256 bit Key

    KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
    keyGen.init(256);
    SecretKey secretKey = keyGen.generateKey();

### Generate a MAC 256 bit key
