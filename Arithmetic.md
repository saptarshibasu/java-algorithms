# Arithmetic Basics

## Arithmetic Progression

### Definition

A sequence of numbers such that the difference between any two successive numbers is constant.

### nth term

t<sub>n</sub> = a + (n-1)d

n - number of terms in the series
t<sub>n</sub> - nth term
a - 1st term
d - difference between two successive terms

### Sum of n terms

S<sub>n</sub> = n(2a + (n - 1)d) / 2

S<sub>n</sub> - Sum of n terms
n - number of terms in the series
a - 1st term
d - difference between two successive terms

## Geometric Progression

### Definition

A sequence of numbers where each term is obtained by multiplying the preceding number by a fixed constant called common ratio.

### nth term

t<sub>n</sub> = ar<sup>n</sup>

t<sub>n</sub> - nth term
a - 1st term
r - common ratio

### Sum of n terms

S<sub>n</sub> = a(r<sup>n</sup> - 1) / (a - 1)

S<sub>n</sub> - Sum of n terms
n - number of terms in the series
a - 1st term
r - common ratio

### Number of nodes in a full binary tree of height n

1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2<sup>n - 1</sup> = (2<sup>n</sup>) - 1

## Permutation

P(n,k) = n! / (n - k)!

## Combination

C(n,k) = n! / (n - k)! k! = P(n, k) / k!
